			General Motors brands overhaul (Chapter 1 - Chevrolet)

			General information
		</h2>
		<div class="yva-main-text yva-main-text-issue">
			Chevrolet is one of the biggest American brands that features hell a lot of regional subsidiaries with completely different lineups across those. Plus, tideous license agreements with numerous third-party auto makers make handling Chevrolet pretty sophisticated.
		</div>
		<h2 class="yva-main-title-secondary">
			What has been done?
		</h2>
		<div class="yva-main-text yva-main-text-issue">
			The whole GM-DAT lineup (i.e. the whole range of European Chevrolet series) has been processed, including its Asian/LADM counterparts. American series from 1990s have just been processed. We lacked some major series and lots of facelifts there (for example, <a class="yva-main-list-link" href="https://www.car.info/en-se/chevrolet/lumina-apv">the whole Lumina APV</a> and <a class="yva-main-list-link" href="https://www.car.info/sv-se/chevrolet/corvette/c4-facelift-19443065">Corvette C4 Facelift</a>). It helped to decrease number of unconnected Chevrolet idents by 29%.
			Just as usual, all the changes imposed include upgrading naming conventions to the latest standards and enhancing engines info with proper engine name and engine code where it's possible.
		</div>
		<h2 class="yva-main-title-secondary">
			Current status
		</h2>
		<div class="yva-main-text yva-main-text-issue">
			Just as usual, you can check overall progress <a class="yva-main-list-link" href="https://1drv.ms/x/s!AkVe6Omg6XmxgbAjr4JQkCU4WUmhcQ">here</a>. I've included a new sheet with table legend for better convenience. Yellow cells denote tier-2 (manily LADM) series, which will be added as soon as the priority ones are done.
		</div>
		<h2 class="yva-main-title-secondary">
			Plans for the next month
		</h2>
		<div class="yva-main-text yva-main-text-issue">
			I'm looking forward to start right away with retrofits of passenger Chevrolet series from 1970-1980s. Especially, I'm fancy to upgrade Caprices, Camaros and Corvettes from that timespan.

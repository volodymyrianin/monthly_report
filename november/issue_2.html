			What has been done?
		</h2>
		<div class="yva-main-text yva-main-text-issue">
			During November Volkswagen <a href="https://www.car.info/sv-se/volkswagen/golf/a4-typ-1j-50883" class="yva-main-list-link">Golf MK4 </a> and <a href="https://www.car.info/sv-se/volkswagen/golf/a5-typ-1k-50885" class="yva-main-list-link">Golf MK5</a> were rewritten. As usual, wgathered all the possible model codes to create the exact patterns for the connections. Moreover, around 15-20 engines per generation were added, all with engine codes according to ERWIN VAG brochures. The work with the MK4 is completed. AS for the MK5, there is a need to upgrade a little the existing rules to achieve more accurate connections.

			While working with VAG rework, we have a lot of opportunities to train new workers, to show them some advanced tools. It was not possible before, because the task was new and complicated. However, right now, when I became more used to work with this task I have some additional time for initial trainings for guys ;)

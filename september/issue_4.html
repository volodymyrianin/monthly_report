			Chevrolet Passenger Series Overhaul
		</h1>
		<h2 class="yva-main-title-secondary">
			General information
		</h2>
		<div class="yva-main-text yva-main-text-issue">
			Chevrolet is one of the largest American brands, pretty wide-spread in Sweden. Thus data quality enhancements on Chevy/GMC (as well as on other American brands) are quite crucial, esp. taking into account steady increase of interest from American auditory. Plus, we've got a very proactive American <a class="yva-main-list-link" href="https://www.car.info/en-se/user/patrickleone">user</a>, who's constantly providing us with pictures of cars which are very rare on this side across the pond. And he's quite meticulous, I must say :)

		<h2 class="yva-main-title-secondary">
			What has been done?
		</h2>
		<div class="yva-main-text yva-main-text-issue">
			All the passenger Chevrolet series up till 1956 model year have been completely overhauled having been applied with the latest guidelines regarding both facelifts and powertrain handling. When I'm done, Chevrolet will look like <a class="yva-main-list-link" href="https://www.car.info/en-se/buick">this</a> brand.

		<h2 class="yva-main-title-secondary">
			Current status
		</h2>
		<div class="yva-main-text yva-main-text-issue">
			You can check overall progress <a class="yva-main-list-link" href="https://1drv.ms/x/s!AkVe6Omg6XmxgbAjr4JQkCU4WUmhcQ">here</a>. Gray series are the retroffitted ones. Green cells represent non-truck series that are yet to be overhauled. This task will have remained being put on a stand-by for another couple of weeks.

		<h2 class="yva-main-title-secondary">
			Plans for the next month
		</h2>
		<div class="yva-main-text yva-main-text-issue">
			Revert this task back to active status. This time I'll start from the latest series first.

			Chevrolet Trucks Overhaul
		</h1>
		<h2 class="yva-main-title-secondary">
			General information
		</h2>
		<div class="yva-main-text yva-main-text-issue">
			Chevrolet trucks became recently a primary topic on Serhij's agenda due to spec-related tasks being performed recently. He is pretty determined that it won't be possible to fill in the specs for those unless they are created and handled properly. That's why Serhij has been pushing gard throught last couple of month to implement the latest guidelines on those putting on stand-by passenger series, since they are not in such a critical state.

			What has been done?
		</h2>
		<div class="yva-main-text yva-main-text-issue">
			As of now, all full-size Chevrolet pickups since early 1920s till recent ones have been completely retrofitted. All the full-size light- and medium-duty pickup series have been created up to GVWR Class 6 inclusive. Surprisingly, there are quite a lot of those in Sweden. Examples: <a class="yva-main-list-link" href="https://www.car.info/sv-se/chevrolet/silverado">Silverado</a>, <a class="yva-main-list-link" href="https://www.car.info/sv-se/chevrolet/silverado-hd">Silverado HD</a> (a separate series as from now), <a class="yva-main-list-link" href="https://www.car.info/sv-se/chevrolet/silverado-md">Silverado MD</a> (high-GVWR medium-duty trucks, i.e. Kodiak replacement).
I'm currently working on revamping medium-size trucks and SUVs, such as Colorado and Trailblazers. The majority of midsizers (including Chinese market) has been covered, too. Changes include complete engine lineup overhauls, applying correct transmissions and latest guidelines in terms of lifespan and naming.

			VAG rework

			General information
		</h2>
		<div class="yva-main-text yva-main-text-issue">
			We continue our work with VAG, for now only with Volkswagen. It is quite long going process considering the amount of information and various variables/

		<h2 class="yva-main-title-secondary">
			What has been done?
		</h2>
		<div class="yva-main-text yva-main-text-issue">
			During October Volkswagen <a href="https://www.car.info/sv-se/volkswagen/golf/golf-cabriolet-a3-facelift-typ-1h-138947" class="yva-main-list-link">Golf MK3 facelift</a> and <a href="https://www.car.info/sv-se/volkswagen/caddy/typ-2k-2nd-facelift-6951492" class="yva-main-list-link">Caddy Typ 2K 2nd Facelift</a> were rewritten. The first one was rewritten according to the plan. AS for the second one, it was urgent request ;)
			However, it showed that the rewriting process for the latest models would be way easier. The reason for it is that those models have some kind of logical model codes pattern.
		</div>
		<h2 class="yva-main-title-secondary">
			Current status
		</h2>
		<div class="yva-main-text yva-main-text-issue">
			Right now it is a time of Golf MK4 ;) almost all the missing engines are added or differentiated. SO, almost everything is ready for the initial AMR rules writing.
		</div>
		<h2 class="yva-main-title-secondary">
			Plans for the next month
		</h2>
		<div class="yva-main-text yva-main-text-issue">
			Main focus is going to be on Golf MK4. If nothing urgent happens there is a possibility that during November MK4 would be done and some preparations for the next generations would be done too :)
		</div>
		<h2 class="yva-main-title-secondary">
			Additional information
		</h2>
		<div class="yva-main-text yva-main-text-issue">
			As soon as the vin codes across VAG are not very informative we started to gather the unique model code information using our classify tool. This time there won`t be any long model codes patterns ;) because, as you coulb figure out from the previous info in this report there are some logical patterns for the newer models` model codes
		</div>
		<div class="yva-main-text yva-main-text-issue">
			Here you may see the model codes` pattern for VW Caddy Typ 2k 2nd Facelift that was figured out during October

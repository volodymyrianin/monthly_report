			General Motors brands overhaul (Chapter 1 - Chevrolet)

			Chevrolet is one of the biggest American brands that features hell a lot of regional subsidiaries with completely different lineups across those. Plus, tideous license agreements with numerous third-party auto makers make handling Chevrolet pretty sophisticated.they are not in such a critical state.

			What has been done?

			As soon as Chevrolet trucks series overhaul had come to its conclusion, I started dealing with non-truck series, but this time I reversed the vector of changes taking care of newer models first. I've covered almost all series from 2010s and I'm on the brink of retrofitthin series from 2000s. All the generations and corresponding engines have been updated according to the latest guidelines. Around 95% of engines have got their proper engine codes now. There's a problem with 2004 European Chevrolet models. Those are essentially the re-badged Daewoo series due to GM-Daewoo early 2000s merger. There are hell a lot of Chevrolet cars being noted by TS as Daewoo and vice versa. Chevrolet and Daewoo VIN did not bare any differences during transitional years (2003-2005) as a part of GM-DAT merger and subsequent liquidadion of Daewoo brand as well. I've traversed through all the Chevrolet/Daewoo Lacetti/Nubira idents with attached media in order to correct brands matching. It took much more time than I had previously expected, but it should not be an issue any longer. Kalos/Aveo, Epica/Tosca, Evanda/Magnus are the next ones on the agenda. <a class="yva-main-list-link" href="https://www.car.info/en-se/callaway">Callaway</a>'s and <a class="yva-main-list-link" href="https://www.car.info/en-se/hennessey">Hennessey</a>'s lineups have been updated to include latest Chevrolet series/generations as well. There are some idents being matched to ordinary Chevrolet that are subject to be re-connected to Hennessey and Callaway in due time.

			Finishing up with Chevrolet 1990-2010 overhauls. I have not touched series from 1990s before, hence, I assume, it's going to be hell of a ride :)

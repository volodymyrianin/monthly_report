			VAG rework
		</h1>
		<h2 class="yva-main-title-secondary">
			General information
		</h2>
		<div class="yva-main-text yva-main-text-issue">
			We are working with VAG almost for the 6 months but still we are only in the beginning of our journey. However, the most difficult model in Volkswagen is almost done. VAG rework is quite a complex task involving a lot of cross brand/model work, meaning that changes in Volkswagen Golf may affect Audi models :p In addition, we are talking about the hundreds of thousands connections that are not always connected to right engines. The reason for it is different engines for different markets. So it is quite important to finish this task to avoid any negative feedbacks related to connections and other issues (like engine volume in cm3, torque which could be different for the engines with the same Volume in L and power output)

			What has been done?
		</h2>
		<div class="yva-main-text yva-main-text-issue">
			During December we did not start any rewritings because our main focus was on altering the existing rules (to bring their quality to some kind of perfection ;) ) WE lowered the number of unconnected idents for Golf and solved all cross model conflicts that were caused due to the same vin codes for Golf and Jetta models. Among the generations that have been rechecked there are the following: <a class="yva-main-list-link" href="https://www.car.info/sv-se/volkswagen/golf/a1-typ-17-facelift-50877">MK1 Facelift</a>, <a class="yva-main-list-link" href="https://www.car.info/sv-se/volkswagen/golf/a2-typ-1g-50879">MK2</a>, <a class="yva-main-list-link" href="https://www.car.info/sv-se/volkswagen/golf/a3-typ-1h-50881">MK3</a>, <a class="yva-main-list-link" href="https://www.car.info/sv-se/volkswagen/golf/golf-cabriolet-a3-facelift-typ-1h-138947">MK3 Facelift</a>, <a class="yva-main-list-link" href="https://www.car.info/sv-se/volkswagen/golf/a4-typ-1j-50883">MK4</a>, <a class="yva-main-list-link" href="https://www.car.info/sv-se/volkswagen/golf/a5-typ-1k-50885">MK5</a>

			Current status
		</h2>
		<div class="yva-main-text yva-main-text-issue">
			During January we are going to work with Golf <a class="yva-main-list-link" href="https://www.car.info/sv-se/volkswagen/golf/a6-typ-5k-50887">MK6</a> and <a class="yva-main-list-link" href="https://www.car.info/sv-se/volkswagen/golf/a7-typ-5g-50889">MK7</a>. As for the first one, the model codes are already gathered and engines were already added / changed. As for the second one, we are going to do the whole circle of rework.

			Plans for the next month
		</h2>
		<div class="yva-main-text yva-main-text-issue">

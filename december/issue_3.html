			General Motors brands overhaul (Chapter 1 - Chevrolet)
		</h1>
		<h2 class="yva-main-title-secondary">
			General information
		</h2>
		<div class="yva-main-text yva-main-text-issue">
			Chevrolet is one of the biggest American brands that features hell a lot of regional subsidiaries with completely different lineups across those. Plus, tideous license agreements with numerous third-party auto makers make handling Chevrolet pretty sophisticated. However, Chevrolet is a key to the whole GM-brands, since the lifespan patterns, chassis and engines are applicable the the whole range of brands constituting GM per se. Thus having Chevrolet covered means at least some template for other brands.

			What has been done?
		</h2>
		<div class="yva-main-text yva-main-text-issue">
			I've retroffitted the whole Chevrolet lineup from 1970s-1980s, including <a class="yva-main-list-link" href="https://www.car.info/sv-se/chevrolet/camaro">Camaro</a>, complete full-size and mid-size range and Nova-based series. I'm merging back wagon series into their corresponding passenger vehicle ranges in order to simplify and standardize series representation, i.e. Kingswood Estate has been moved to <a class="yva-main-list-link" href="https://www.car.info/sv-se/chevrolet/caprice">Caprice</a>, Kingswood to <a class="yva-main-list-link" href="https://www.car.info/sv-se/chevrolet/impala">Impala</a>, Townsmans to <a class="yva-main-list-link" href="https://www.car.info/sv-se/chevrolet/bel-air">Bel Air</a> and Parkwood to <a class="yva-main-list-link" href="https://www.car.info/sv-se/chevrolet/biscayne">Biscayne</a>. Furthermore, I've covered Canadian lineup of Chevrolet cars from 1970s as well. There are some Canadian specific powerplant-chassis combination which we have not covered up until now. Not many idents were influenced (example, <a class="yva-main-list-link" href="https://www.car.info/sv-se/admin/ident/1220850">this</a> Canadian Chevrolet Chevelle Malibu Sport Sedan equipped with 6-cylinder Turbo-Thrift 250 engine), I must say, but it's quite unique info nobody really covers anywhere else across the web. I'm working with my all-time favorite Chevrolet series right now (i.e. <a class="yva-main-list-link" href="https://www.car.info/sv-se/chevrolet/chevelle">1968-1972 Chevelle</a>, including El Caminos). I will have finised this one by next Tuesday.
As a result the number of unconnected idents has decreased by further ~20%. We are on the brink of breaching 500 unconnected idents threshold.

			Current status
		</h2>
		<div class="yva-main-text yva-main-text-issue">
			Just as usual, you can check overall progress <a class="yva-main-list-link" href="https://1drv.ms/x/s!AkVe6Omg6XmxgbAjr4JQkCU4WUmhcQ">here</a>. I've included a new sheet with table legend for better convenience. Yellow cells denote tier-2 (manily LADM) series, which will be added as soon as the priority ones are done. I'm currently on track with retrofits being implemented slightly a bit ahead of my schedule. The progress is severely hampered by crappy Transport Styrelsen VIN-code data (they are prone to misplasing crucial VIN-symbols or truncating the whole segments of VIN), thus, besides proper VIN-based AMR-rules,  I'm forced to crete monstrous fallback AMR-rules (I call those tier-2 rules) which are based on model field in order to cover those idents whose VIN data is completely screwed up.

			Plans for the next month
		</h2>
		<div class="yva-main-text yva-main-text-issue">
			I'm planning on covering Chevrolet series from 1960s, and, probably, if I manage to push a bit harder and the data on those is not that bad, the remaining ones from 1950-ish model years. In addition, I'm going to start AMR- and creation training for selected number of guys. Right now I'm conducting a visual guide a la " Creation How-To" and "AMR How-To".
